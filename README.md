crypto tools for Fabric, as a plugin project written in Java.

It contains some cryptography tools, such as:
* SM2: key generation, encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify (like RSA)
* SM3: calculate digest of a message (like SHA256)
* SM4: key generation, encrypt/decrypt (like AES)
* Paillier: key generation, addCipherText/subCipherText, addPlainText/mulPlainText/divPlainText

This project is inspired by some great projects, thanks them.
